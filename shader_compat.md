# List of compatible shaders

__DISCLAIMER__: Some shaders add wavy water which means that the water will clip with the wake textures. 
In some cases there will be an option to disable this.

## [Iris](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) shaders
- Complementary V4
- Complementary Reimagined*
- Rethinking Voxels
- Shrimple

\*Note
- Complementary Reimagined: Wakes sometimes suddenly disappear or have strange colors. See [issue 17](https://github.com/Goby56/wakes/issues/17) and [issue 21](https://github.com/Goby56/wakes/issues/21).

### Known incompatibilties
- LS RenderPearl
- BSL (can't figure out how to turn off wavy water, aside from that it works fine)
- Overimagined Shaders (works when camera is close to the water)

## Optifine shaders
Currently not supported
