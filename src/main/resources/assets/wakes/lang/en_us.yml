            first_person_splash_plane: >
                Should the player's splash plane be seen while in first person?
            wave_propagation_factor: >
                The impact a pixels has on its neighboring pixels inside the wakes
            wave_decay_factor: >
                Specifies how much of a pixels value is left after each tick. (Logarithmic scale)
            initial_wave_strengths: >
                The strength a source starts with to produce a wake.
            splash_plane.cap_velocity: >
                The velocity at which the maximum size of the splash plane is reached
            effect_spawning_rules: "Specifies which effect(s) a source (player, mob, etc) can produce. \n\nSimulation refers to the simulated waves on the water that acts as wakes. \n\nPlanes refers to the splashes that shoot out on either side."
            wake_resolution: >
                The pixel resolution of the wakes. Good for adjusting the wakes to better visually fit some resource packs.
            shader_light_passthrough: >
                Used to fine tune the appearance of wakes when using shaders. A higher value yields brighter wakes.
